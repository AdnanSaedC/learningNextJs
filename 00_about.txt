//its build on top on react js

you have to keep everything in src directoty 
then we have app directory

middlewares should be inside src

which has API( which also contain backend and route which help for routing) and in fontend routing is handled by page

look NEXTJS is a frameWork naming convention and very important here very very 

page.tsx does everything which happend in the client side

you dont need express here

look if you want to craeate a page here simple craete a folder in that folder add a file page.tsx and add your content there

NEXTJS is a edge run frameWork what it means is that everytime you have to make connection and NEXTJS dont persist connections

here everything on the frontend is treated as serve components
it can access everything on the server 

the default behaviour is treat everything as server components
if we want to design something for frontend we have to explictly make it a client a components

we are going to setup the backend
